Prince

My mother is seventy-seven and has been living in Autumn Palace for several weeks. The name of the senior center refers to autumn because most residents belong to the third age. There are other institutions for the fourth age, but they do not have 'winter' in their name either; winter makes you think of death and that is not allowed. Autumn implies richness of colors, life experience.

In the car, on the way to Autumn Palace, my mother repeatedly called the thinking surrounding the naming hypocritical. Although she had insisted on moving to the center herself, she now dreaded it and even went so far as to claim that I had forced her. That was to be expected. My mother spent a significant part of her life in a frenzy of furious indignation, self-pity and an energetic kind of death instinct. Because she also has taste and a sense of humor, can be sweet sometimes and is old, I bit my tongue and kept my attention focused on the road. I wouldn't blame her for what that stay would cost me. She was not allowed to feel like a burden and not have the opportunity to accuse me of stinginess.

However, I also felt embarrassed. I thought about her forgetfulness in recent months, only to be convinced again that she could not continue to live independently. She said she had been discovering symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in herself since she was forty, but recently they no longer seemed pretended. I had found a dozen moldy gingerbread cookies and a dead great tit among the winter sweaters in her wardrobe. She had reacted furiously when I pointed it out to her, and with a confused story she had tried to blame my husband. She had never liked him, nor did he like her. However, on my next visit, to my surprise and relief, she had brought up the senior center herself.

There was no other way. I knew it, she knew it. What made me especially uncomfortable was that I had not visited her new home in advance, because she had initially been enthusiastic and I was busy. I only knew the center from a 3D presentation on the internet. The phrase: 'Each room with its own assistance (AI)' had since become barbed in my mind. Suspecting that the prospect of having a maid of my own explained my mother's preference for Autumn Palace, I decided not to tell her that I thought the AI ​​stood for Artificial Intelligence. I had seen a documentary about it before. After a labor shortage eroded the healthcare sector piece by piece for half a century and a shocking number of elderly people forgotten by nurses were found dead on toilet bowls, Europe had invested heavily in robots to do the job over the last decade. The new models were reportedly a far cry from the wooden pets and staff of the first experiments. The elderly would respond well to it. It was said to be a matter of company.

Beside me, my mother sighed dramatically, "What are you doing to me, Clara!" She didn't seem to want to add anything.

I took my eyes off the road for a moment and said it wouldn't be too bad.

She shook her head smugly. It wouldn't be easy. She would take care of that.
.
A little later we walked through the center's spacious lobby, looking up at the vaulted glass structure of the ceiling. Her silence indicated that Mom, like me, was impressed by the architecture and furnishings. The building reminded me of a modern train station, although the abundant light, the art on the walls and the many flowers and plants created a more homely feeling. I wondered whether many additional costs would be charged. This is what it looked like here.

"Still beautiful," I said.

My mother grumbled as dismissively as possible, but was unable to take her eyes off her surroundings. There was piano music playing, Chopin I guessed, but otherwise it was quiet. I wondered where the other elderly people were. The only staff member was a blonde at an elliptical desk. She welcomed us with a broad, somewhat proud smile.

“Hi ladies,” she said. 'Can I help you?' She spoke rather casually, I thought, forced casually, and something about her appearance was so impeccably beautiful that it aroused in me an uncertain revulsion. I had to get over it.

“My mother…” I started. It was my intention to subtly give vent to my mother's objections and difficult character as a warning, but she immediately took over with a firm: 'Here is a room for me. Irene D'Hondt.'

Maybe it was because it had been so long since I'd heard my mother say her own name that it seemed to mean something.

The blonde didn't seem to have to look anything up. She stared silently and smiling for a few seconds and then said that Prince was coming. I thought I misheard his name.

My mother noticed him first, and what I saw on her face made me watch her curiously. A nicely built Asian man strode towards us. He wore his thick hair in a ponytail and happily extended a hand to us. He continued to hold my mother's.

“Prince,” Mom repeated.

“Hi, Irène,” said Prins. He nodded briefly and somewhat absently at me. "Are you Irène's sister?" he asked.

'Her daughter!' I said, immediately embarrassed by the way my anger accentuated the insult. I'm fifty-four.

My mother cooed and beamed.

“My apologies,” Prins said. I was suddenly certain that he had made the mistake on purpose. He took her arm, her heavy suitcase lightly in his other hand. I lifted her beauty case and followed them. I had a hard time keeping up with them.

He led her into a quiet, cozy room with lots of design – the kind of room I knew she liked. She was still beaming.

I had been studying the transparent booth in the corner for a while when the letters 'AI' came back to me. With a start I turned to Prins. That couldn't be possible, could it? He handed me a cup of coffee and turned back to my mother.

“You set our daily rhythm,” he said. 'And if you want it to be different, we will do it differently. The number of possibilities is not infinite, but that's how it feels.'

I was overcome by the need to warn her. That Prince may not have been real. Did she know that? Did I know that? It seemed like an absurd thought that would only cast doubt on my own mental health.

Ultimately he created clarity himself. His artificiality turned out to be no secret. After reading a poem to my mother and making her a light salad - all of which he increasingly ignored my presence - he locked himself in the transparent cabin.

“Just recharge,” he said to my mother through the plexiglass. He then rolled up a sleeve of his shirt and inserted a flatbed charger, connected to a panel at the rear of the cab, into a small slot in his forearm.

So now she could see that he wasn't real. That I paid this center to have a doll cared for her. I expected protest and felt too tired or simply unable to justify the scenes in which Prins had acted since our arrival. That's certainly not how I imagined AI.

He held an index finger against the transparent wall and my mother – the mother whose cynical talent had caused people to flee and who had kept telling me, her daughter, for years that it was better not to bring children into the world – that mother pressed her fingertip on the other side of the wall against Prince's, and looked up at him innocently.
.
"Don't hang up," I say sternly.

She's done it before this week, and the week before that too. She tells me not to call so often. And you certainly don't have to come by.

“But everything is going well,” she says with mock patience. "That concern is really unnecessary."

'Did you drink?' I ask. She sounds like that.

'Prince and I cracked a bottle. I'm seventy-seven. That's allowed.'

'Is he drinking?'

'Not excessively. Jesus.'

'No, I mean... Is he eating? Does he drink? Is he going to the toilet?'

It's quiet for a moment.

"Yes," she then says.

I don't believe her.

'Mama', I say and I decided not to put it so bluntly, but I do it anyway: 'Mama, Prince is not real. You know that. You know that, right? That he's not real?'

'Ah!' my mother says. A reaction that I don't immediately know what to do with.

'He's an artificial intelligence. A robot, in fact. We should have talked about that earlier. It is my fault.'

'A robot?' She starts laughing. 'Then a warm one with soft skin!'

I shake my head a bit to dispel the image that comes to mind. Does she really not know? The laugh swells. I hate that kind of laughing.

"Why do you think that charging booth is there?" I want her to hear how angry I am, how desperate.
“Oh, that,” she mutters. She no longer smiles now. Maybe my words got through.

"Shall I come get you?" I ask. She can live with me, for now. We'll find a way.

"Do you know what your problem is?" she asks.

I know what she'll say before she does it.

'You are jealous.'

This time I'm the one who hangs up.

After pacing around the kitchen for a while, I throw an apple and a handful of strawberries into the blender. It's a new, expensive thing, and after a brief but furious buzz it implodes with a spark. I never liked machines, nor did they like me.

Wanting to cry and be held, I descend the stairs to my husband's music studio. When I come in he sits with his back to me. He wears headphones, so he doesn't hear me calling his name. I walk around the mixing desk and the piano and wave into his field of view. Because I sense that he won't like my tears, because I know he never likes them, I smile mischievously. He sits in an unmoving cross-legged position, then raises a finger to his lips. I have to be quiet. He closes his eyes.
